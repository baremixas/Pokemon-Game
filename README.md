## General info

The program ultimately is meant to be a Pokemon battle simulator, where you can fight against other players or computer.

At the beginning there will be avaible only starter pokemons, however I will be adding more in future.

I haven't yet decided if the script will be running on a web page or as a standalone application.

## Future

The game is yet in super-early stage.

In next update I plan to add more pokemon moves, statuses such as paralysis or burn and implement their usage.
For the moment I added some skills and statuses, but they need more work to work properly.

In the end I will be working on combining all the features and making small interface for user to play the game.
